This photo of Lena (Lenna) Söderberg is the most widely used test
image for computer vision applications. I have made a conscious
decision to use this image for examples on this webpage. We should be
respectful of the woman in the photo and know how this image came to
be. Read about the photo at [[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~chuck/lennapg/lenna.shtml][The Lenna story]].

* OpenCV

All the code in the computer vision examples uses OpenCV. The OpenCV
homepage is [[http://opencv.org][opencv.org]]; you'll want to look at their [[http://docs.opencv.org/2.4.3/modules/refman.html][reference manual]]
and [[http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html][tutorials]], in particular [[http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction][tutorials about installation]].
